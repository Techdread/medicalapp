# Project: MedGemma Educational Medical App

## 1. Vision & Goal

To create an interactive educational application for medical students that leverages the MedGemma multimodal AI model. The app aims to assist students in understanding medical terminology, interpreting medical images, and developing their diagnostic reasoning skills in a safe, simulated environment.

## 2. Core Features

The application will eventually include the following core features:

1.  **Medical Terminology Explainer (MVP):** Allows students to input medical terms or phrases and receive clear, concise explanations generated by MedGemma.
2.  **Image Exploration Mode:** Enables students to upload or select pre-loaded medical images. MedGemma will provide descriptions, and students can ask follow-up questions about the images.
3.  **"Guess the Finding" Quiz:** Presents students with medical images and asks them to identify key findings. MedGemma will provide feedback and explanations.

## 3. Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: Next.js (React)
    *   UI Components: shadcn/ui
    *   Styling: Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:**
    *   Framework: FastAPI (Python)
    *   Language: Python
*   **AI Model:**
    *   Model: `google/medgemma-4b-it` (or other suitable MedGemma variants)
    *   Integration: Hugging Face `transformers` library.
    *   Deployment: Initially local using available GPUs (NVIDIA 3090/3060), with potential for cloud-based inference later.
*   **Database (Potential Future Use):**
    *   For storing user accounts, curated image datasets, quiz questions/answers (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## 4. Key Considerations

*   **Ethical Use & Disclaimers:**
    *   The application is strictly for educational purposes and **not** a diagnostic tool.
    *   Clear disclaimers must be prominently displayed throughout the app, stating that outputs are AI-generated, may not be accurate, and should not be used for real-world medical decision-making.
*   **Data Privacy & Security:**
    *   If students can upload images, strict de-identification protocols must be enforced.
    *   For pre-loaded datasets, ensure all images are properly anonymized and licensed for this type of use.
*   **Model Limitations:**
    *   Acknowledge and manage MedGemma's limitations (e.g., potential for inaccuracies, biases, single-turn focus).
    *   Implement mechanisms for feedback on model outputs.
*   **Scalability:** Design with future scalability in mind, especially regarding model serving and data management.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Focus on an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate learning.

## 5. Development Phases

1.  **Phase 1 (MVP):** Develop and test the "Medical Terminology Explainer."
2.  **Phase 2:** Implement the "Image Exploration Mode" with a curated set of images.
3.  **Phase 3:** Develop the "Guess the Finding" Quiz.
4.  **Phase 4:** User testing, feedback incorporation, and potential feature enhancements (e.g., user accounts, progress tracking).
