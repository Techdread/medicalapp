# MVP: Medical Terminology Explainer

## 1. Feature Overview

The "Medical Terminology Explainer" will be the first feature developed for the MedGemma Educational App. It allows medical students to input a medical term or a short phrase, and the application will use the MedGemma model to provide a clear and concise explanation suitable for a student audience.

## 2. Objective

*   To provide students with a quick and accessible way to understand complex medical terminology.
*   To validate the core backend integration with the MedGemma model using text-based input and output.
*   To establish the basic frontend-backend communication pipeline.

## 3. User Flow

1.  **User Input:** The student navigates to the "Terminology Explainer" section of the app. They see an input field.
2.  **Term Submission:** The student types a medical term (e.g., "myocardial infarction," "pneumothorax," "iatrogenic") or a short phrase into the input field and clicks a "Explain" button.
3.  **Processing:**
    *   The frontend sends the term/phrase to the backend.
    *   The backend constructs an appropriate prompt for MedGemma (e.g., "Explain the medical term '[USER_TERM]' for a medical student in simple terms.").
    *   The backend sends the prompt to the locally running MedGemma model.
4.  **Display Output:**
    *   MedGemma generates an explanation.
    *   The backend receives the explanation and sends it back to the frontend.
    *   The frontend displays the explanation clearly to the student.
5.  **Repeat:** The student can then enter another term.

## 4. Technical Implementation

*   **Frontend (Next.js, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS):**
    *   A dedicated page/component for the Terminology Explainer.
    *   An input component (`<Input />` from shadcn/ui) for the term.
    *   A button component (`<Button />` from shadcn/ui) to submit.
    *   A display area (e.g., a `<Card />` or styled `<div>`) to show the explanation.
    *   State management for the input term and the received explanation.
    *   API call function to send the term to the backend and receive the explanation.

*   **Backend (FastAPI, Python):**
    *   An API endpoint (e.g., `/api/explain-term`).
        *   Method: `POST`
        *   Request body: `{ "term": "user_input_term" }`
        *   Response body: `{ "explanation": "model_generated_explanation" }` or error message.
    *   Logic to receive the term, construct the prompt.
    *   Integration with the MedGemma model using the `transformers` library.
        *   Load the `google/medgemma-4b-it` model onto one of the local GPUs.
        *   Process the input prompt and generate output.
    *   Error handling (e.g., if the model fails to generate a response).

*   **Model Interaction (MedGemma):**
    *   Prompt Engineering: Experiment with different prompt structures to ensure explanations are accurate, concise, and appropriate for medical students. Example prompt:
        ```
        System: You are a helpful AI assistant explaining medical terms to a medical student.
        User: Explain the medical term: "{term_from_user}"
        ```
    *   Parameter Tuning: Adjust generation parameters (e.g., `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`) if necessary.

## 5. Success Criteria for MVP

*   Students can successfully input a medical term and receive a relevant explanation.
*   The explanation is generated by the MedGemma model.
*   The round-trip time for a request (from submit to display) is reasonable (e.g., under 5-10 seconds for local inference).
*   Basic error handling is in place (e.g., message if the model doesn't respond).
*   The UI is clean, simple, and usable.
*   The core Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend are set up and communicating.

## 6. Key Disclaimers for MVP

*   The explainer tool must clearly state that the information is AI-generated, for educational purposes only, and should not be used for clinical decisions.
*   Acknowledge that explanations may not always be perfect or cover all nuances.
